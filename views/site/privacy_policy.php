            <<p>At Prefectword, we value the privacy and the confidentiality of every customer visiting our
                site very much.
                As such, we recommend that every user reads through these policies from time to time before using our
                services.</p>

            <p>As stated above, verifiedprofessors.com values the privacy of all customers.
                As such, we like making their personal identity 100% anonymous.
                We do not share any personal details disclosed to us by our customers or writers to any other third
                party.
                We treat all personal information as private and confidential.
                As a customer, we strongly advise that you do not share any personal information with our writers.
                This information may include your name, email, phone number, school or school logins.</p>

            <p>At all time, verifiedprofessors.com will act as the link between the customer and the writer, and as
                such,
                we reserve the right to close the account of a customer who willingly discloses his/her
                personal information to any writer without notice. In cases where such information may be needed to
                complete the task for clients, for example with online timed exams, the customer should contact the
                customer support team before making such a move. We strongly advise our customers against taking any
                personal emails or contacts sent to them by our writers. Any transactions which are done outside this
                website between the customer and the writer is without any guarantee whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Customers should report any writer who tries to share their personal emails or contacts with them to the
                support team immediately so that action can be taken against such a writer. We do not condone fraud.</p>

            <p>We are professional people, and therefore we expect our writers to observe professionalism at all times.
                Professionalism involves how you chat with our customers. Observe etiquette at all times in your chats
                with your customers.
                Do not share any personal information such as emails and contacts with our customers as this violates
                our privacy policy.
                We always monitor the writer-client chats and therefore and therefore will heavily fine or fire any
                writer that tries to
                share their emails and contacts with their customers. No form of explanation will be accepted for such
                an act whether
                deliberately or by mistake. We, therefore, recommend that you be very keen on what you send to your
                customer in your chats.</p>
            <p>We might collect other information such as your IP address and your access time.
                We may also use cookies which helps us serve you better.
                The cookies help us identify your computer without getting the identity of the individual user.
                These cookies also help us to understand the pages of our website that you visited and how much time you
                spent on each of the
                pages you visited.</p>

                deliver your orders on time so that you have enough time to review them.

                That way, we will make sure that we deliver the best service to you as you order with us every time.
                However, it is important to note that the above-collected information is only used by us and not shared

                purpose.</p>
